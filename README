-----------------------------------------------------PROJECT DESCRIPTION-----------------------------------------------------
1. Sawtooth Oscillator for core sound generation.
  1.1. Oscillator volume control using an encoder. Up to 80 % it works like a normal volume control. If set higher it will go into distortion mode
2. Frequency Control via:
  2.1. Membrane Potentiometer
  2.2. Four Octave Shift Buttons
  2.3. Optional Scale Quantization (e.g., fixed to piano notes)
    2.3.1 Portamento(note sliding) is controlled using an encoder
3. Amplitude Control using a Pressure Sensor.
4. Pre-Switch Filter for frequency cutoff:
  4.1. Selectable cutoff at 100 Hz or 500 Hz
  4.2. Mode switch to toggle between cutoff frequencies
5. Formant Filter Section with two identical filters:
  5.1. Each filter can be individually enabled or disabled
  5.2. Each filter includes:
    5.2.1. Volume Potentiometer. Up to 80 % it works like a normal volume control. If set higher it will go into distortion mode
    5.2.2. Frequency Potentiometer
    5.2.3. Resonance Potentiometer
    5.2.4. Cutoff Frequency Range Switch (640 Hz or 6 kHz)
    5.2.5. Mode Switch (Bandpass or Lowpass)
6. Master Volume Control via a single Potentiometer.


--------------------------------------------------------------COURSE OF WORK--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Implemented Sawtooth Wave Generation
  Developed the core function for generating a basic sawtooth waveform.
2. Integrated Analog Inputs for Control
  Connected and configured analog inputs to:
    Control frequency using a membrane potentiometer
    Control amplitude using a pressure sensor
3. Added 1x4 Keypad for Octave Selection
  Implemented a keypad interface allowing octave shifts via four dedicated buttons.
4. Developed PolyBLEP Function for Antialiasing
  Wrote a PolyBLEP (Polynomial Band-Limited Step) algorithm to reduce aliasing artifacts in the sawtooth oscillator.
5. Wrote First-Order IIR Filter for Pre-Switch Filtering
  Created a simple IIR filter for low-pass filtering at 100 Hz or 500 Hz, selectable via switch.
6. Implemented Timer for Button Debouncing
  Prevented false triggers and ensured accurate input readings by adding a timer-based debouncing function.
7. Created Formant Filter Functions
  Designed and implemented second-order IIR filters for formant filtering.
  Enabled control of volume, frequency, and resonance.
8. Added Additional Analog Inputs
  Connected further potentiometers for the formant filters and master volume control.
9. Implemented 4x4 Keypad
  Expanded the user input interface to a 4x4 keypad for additional controls and modes.
10. Integrated Rotary Encoders
  Added two encoders:
    One for oscillator volume (including distortion mode above 80%)
    One for portamento (note sliding) control
11. Wrote Soft Clipping Function
  Implemented a soft clipping (distortion) algorithm used when volume exceeds 80%.
12. Developed Noise Reduction Functions
  Added:
  Moving Average Filter to smooth out signal fluctuations
  Noise Gate to suppress low-level residual noise caused by aliasing


--------------------------------------------------------------USED COMPONENTS--------------------------------------------------------------
7 potentiometers, 1 membrane pot, 1 pressure sensor, 1x4 keypad, 4x4 keypad, STM32F407G-DISC1 board, 2 encoders.
